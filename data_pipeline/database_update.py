"""
USports Basketball Data Processing Script

This script is used to override the old tables with the new table containing the latest data fetched from the USports website. The usports_team_stats and usports_player_stats functions, which are imported from another Python file, are used to parse through the USports website and collect statistics into pandas DataFrame objects.

Dependencies:
- SQLAlchemy: Used for interacting with the MySQL database.

Usage:
- Before running the script, ensure that a MySQL database is set up and accessible.
- Modify the connection_string variable to specify the connection details for the MySQL database.
- Ensure that the necessary tables and schema are set up in the database.
- Execute the script to fetch, process, and store the basketball statistics data in the database.
