# U SPORTS BASKETBALL WEB APP (TO BE DEPLOYED) üèÄ

This website is a platform for sharing analytics and insights into the Canadian university basketball league, or U Sports. I am passionate about basketball and data analysis, and this project allows me to combine the two.

<a name="readme-top"></a>

## Goal
I want to provide valuable data-driven insights and analytics to basketball enthusiasts, coaches, players, fans, and prospective professional league stakeholders such as the CEBL so that they can better understand and enjoy U Sports basketball. Through this project, I aim to promote the sport and help it grow in Canadian universities.

## Project Structure

The U SPORTS BASKETBALL WEB APP project is organized into two main folders:

1. **data_pipeline**: This folder contains scripts and functions for updating the database with the latest data from the USports website.

    > Note: [usports-basketball](https://github.com/ojadeyemi/usports-basketball "Python package for current usports basketball stats") has been integrated as a dependency in web application development. This allows for independent script maintenance and updates while ensuring seamless integration with the application's data processing pipelines. 

    > NOTE: USPORTS has changed the structure of their website therefore  [usports-basketball](https://github.com/ojadeyemi/usports-basketball "Python package for current usports basketball stats") package will not be able to webscape data. Hopefully I find out how to update it. 

2. **usport_flask_app**: This folder contains the Flask application code. It includes the routes, models, and other web application files.
